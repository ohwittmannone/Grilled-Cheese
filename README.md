Do you love grilled cheese as much as me? Well now you can set your phone's wallpaper to a picture of a random grilled cheese or today's hottest post from the Subreddit [/r/grilledcheese!](https://www.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/) I made this app to get familiar with/show off some libraries.

The purpose of this was to get used MVVM using ViewModels and to use Jetpack libs with coroutines.
